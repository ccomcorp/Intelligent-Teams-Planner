# Intelligent Microsoft Teams Planner MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable natural language task management for Microsoft Planner within Teams environment
- Eliminate context switching between Teams and Planner applications
- Provide conversational AI interface for basic CRUD operations on Planner tasks
- Generate automated reports and summaries from Planner data
- Create foundation for future enterprise-grade features

### Background Context
Microsoft Teams users frequently experience workflow friction when managing tasks in Planner, requiring constant context switching between applications. This MVP addresses the core productivity challenge by providing a conversational AI assistant directly within the Teams environment, enabling users to manage Planner tasks through natural language commands.
