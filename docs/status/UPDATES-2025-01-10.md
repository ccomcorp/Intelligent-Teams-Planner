## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Validate RAG Service**
   - Test 24 Python files in `rag-service/src/`
   - Verify document processing pipeline
   - Integrate with other services if functional

2. **Choose Next Epic**
   - Option A: Complete Epic 6 (RAG service) if validation passes
   - Option B: Implement Epic 7 Story 7.2 (document generator for FR5)
   - Option C: Defer advanced features and focus on MVP

### Short-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. Complete MVP core features
2. Integration testing
3. Documentation alignment

### Long-Term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. MVP completion (all 7 services)
2. Production deployment
3. User testing and iteration
