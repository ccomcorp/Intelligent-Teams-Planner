4. **Container and Dependency Security**: Implement comprehensive container image scanning, software composition analysis (SCA), and supply chain security monitoring
5. **Security Configuration Assessment**: Deploy continuous security configuration scanning with industry benchmark compliance and misconfiguration detection
6. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrate multiple threat intelligence feeds with automated correlation, indicator of compromise (IoC) matching, and threat hunting capabilities
7. **Remediation Workflow Automation**: Create intelligent remediation workflows with auto-remediation for low-risk vulnerabilities and orchestrated response for critical findings
8. **Vulnerability Metrics and Reporting**: Deploy comprehensive vulnerability management dashboard with metrics tracking, trend analysis, and executive reporting
