## Status
**ON HOLD** - Enterprise features

## Epic Overview

**As a** DevOps engineer and platform operator,
**I want** comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure as code, and automated development environments,
**so that** the Intelligent Teams Planner v2.0 can be deployed, scaled, and maintained with enterprise-grade automation and reliability.

## Epic Goal

Establish a complete DevOps automation platform that enables continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration at scale, and streamlined development environment setup. This epic transforms the platform from manual deployment to fully automated, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure.

## Business Value

- **Infrastructure Reliability**: 99.99% infrastructure uptime through automation and monitoring
- **Development Productivity**: 80% reduction in environment setup time for developers
- **Operational Efficiency**: 70% reduction in manual operational tasks
- **Scalability Assurance**: Automatic scaling based on demand without manual intervention
- **Cost Optimization**: Dynamic resource allocation reducing infrastructure costs by 40%

## Architecture Enhancement

### Current State Analysis
- Manual deployment processes
- Basic Docker Compose setup
- No infrastructure automation
- Manual environment configuration

### Target State Vision

## Stories

### Story 3.1: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, security scanning, and multi-environment deployment,
**so that** code changes can be safely and automatically deployed from development to production.

### Story 3.2: Container Orchestration and Scaling
**As a** platform operator,
**I want** Kubernetes-based container orchestration with auto-scaling and high availability,
**so that** the application can handle varying loads and maintain consistent performance.

### Story 3.3: Infrastructure as Code
**As a** infrastructure engineer,
**I want** complete infrastructure defined and provisioned through code,
**so that** environments are consistent, reproducible, and can be managed through version control.

### Story 3.4: Development Environment Automation
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated development environment setup and management,
**so that** I can focus on coding rather than environment configuration and maintenance.
