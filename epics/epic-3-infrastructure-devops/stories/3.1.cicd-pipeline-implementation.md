# Story 3.1: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, security scanning, and multi-environment deployment,
**so that** code changes can be safely and automatically deployed from development to production.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Automated Build Pipeline**: Triggered builds on code commits with artifact generation
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
3. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning for code and dependencies
4. **Quality Gates**: Code quality validation with SonarQube integration
5. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Automated deployment to dev, staging, and production
6. **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback on deployment failures
7. **Artifact Management**: Versioned artifact storage and management
8. **Pipeline Monitoring**: Real-time pipeline execution monitoring and alerting

### Testing Strategy

**Testing Framework Integration:**
- pytest for Python backend testing
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- k6 for performance testing
- Testcontainers for integration testing

**Test Categories:**
```yaml
testing:
  unit_tests:
    framework: pytest
    coverage_threshold: 80
    parallel_execution: true
    timeout: 5_minutes
  
  integration_tests:
    framework: pytest + testcontainers
    database_required: true
    redis_required: true
    timeout: 10_minutes
  
  e2e_tests:
    framework: playwright
    browsers: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
    parallel_execution: true
    timeout: 15_minutes
  
  performance_tests:
    framework: k6
    load_scenarios: [smoke, load, stress, spike]
    timeout: 20_minutes
```

**Quality Gates Configuration:**
```yaml
quality_gates:
  code_coverage:
    minimum: 80
    difference_threshold: -2  # No decrease more than 2%
  
  sonarqube:
    quality_gate: "Sonar way"
    bugs: 0
    vulnerabilities: 0
    code_smells: "<= 5"
    coverage: ">= 80"
    duplications: "<= 3"
  
  security:
    vulnerabilities: 0
    secrets: 0
    license_compliance: true
```

### Deployment Strategies

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Blue-Green deployment script

CURRENT_ENV=$(kubectl get service app-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.version}')
NEW_ENV=$([ "$CURRENT_ENV" = "blue" ] && echo "green" || echo "blue")

# Deploy to new environment
helm upgrade app-$NEW_ENV ./charts/app --set version=$NEW_ENV --set image.tag=$IMAGE_TAG

# Run health checks
./scripts/cd/smoke-test.sh $NEW_ENV

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  # Switch traffic
  kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"'$NEW_ENV'"}}'
  echo "Deployment successful: switched to $NEW_ENV"
else
  echo "Deployment failed: rolling back"
  ./scripts/cd/rollback.sh
  exit 1
fi
```

**Rolling Deployment:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rolling deployment script

helm upgrade app ./charts/app \
  --set image.tag=$IMAGE_TAG \
  --set deployment.strategy.type=RollingUpdate \
  --set deployment.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable=1 \
  --set deployment.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge=1

# Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/app --timeout=600s

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Rolling deployment failed: initiating rollback"
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/app
  exit 1
fi
```

### Monitoring and Observability

**Pipeline Metrics:**
- Build duration and success rate
- Test execution time and pass rate
- Security scan results and trends
- Deployment frequency and success rate
- Rollback frequency and mean time to recovery

**Alerting Configuration:**
```yaml
alerting:
  pipeline_failure:
    channels: [slack, email]
    severity: high
    conditions:
      - build_failure
      - test_failure
      - security_violation
      - deployment_failure
  
  performance_degradation:
    channels: [slack]
    severity: medium
    conditions:
      - build_time > 15_minutes
      - test_time > 20_minutes
      - deployment_time > 10_minutes
  
  quality_gate_failure:
    channels: [slack, email]
    severity: high
    conditions:
      - coverage_below_threshold
      - sonarqube_quality_gate_failure
      - security_vulnerabilities_found
```
