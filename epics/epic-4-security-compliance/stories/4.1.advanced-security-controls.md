# Story 4.1: Advanced Security Controls

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** security engineer,
**I want** comprehensive security controls including zero-trust architecture, advanced access controls, and security policy enforcement,
**so that** the system maintains the highest security standards and prevents unauthorized access.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Zero-Trust Architecture Implementation**: Implement comprehensive zero-trust security model with identity verification, device trust validation, and continuous authorization for all access requests
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Deploy adaptive MFA system with support for multiple authentication factors including biometrics, hardware tokens, and risk-based authentication
3. **Advanced Access Control System**: Implement fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) with attribute-based access control (ABAC) and just-in-time (JIT) access provisioning
4. **Security Policy Enforcement**: Deploy automated security policy enforcement engine with real-time policy validation and violation prevention
5. **Encryption Standards Implementation**: Implement end-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption with proper key management
6. **Network Security Controls**: Deploy comprehensive network security including micro-segmentation, network access control (NAC), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
7. **API Security Framework**: Implement comprehensive API security with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, rate limiting, API gateway security, and threat protection
8. **Security Configuration Management**: Deploy infrastructure as code security configurations with automated security baseline enforcement and drift detection
