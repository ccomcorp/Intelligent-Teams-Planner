## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** team member working remotely and on-the-go,
**I want** full-featured mobile applications and cross-platform compatibility across all devices and operating systems,
**so that** I can access, manage, and collaborate on projects seamlessly regardless of my device or location.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Native Mobile Applications**: Develop native iOS and Android apps with full feature parity to web application
2. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Create responsive PWA with offline capabilities and app-like experience
3. **Cross-Platform Desktop Support**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux with native desktop applications
4. **Responsive Design Excellence**: Ensure optimal user experience across all screen sizes and orientations
5. **Offline Functionality**: Enable core features to work offline with automatic sync when reconnected
6. **Push Notifications**: Implement real-time notifications across all platforms for critical updates
7. **Platform-Specific Integrations**: Leverage native platform features (camera, GPS, biometrics, file system)
8. **Unified Data Synchronization**: Ensure seamless data sync across all devices and platforms in real-time
