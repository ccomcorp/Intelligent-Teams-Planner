# Intelligent Dev Agent Workflow

## Task Purpose
Execute intelligent development workflows with automatic complexity analysis, optimal LLM routing, and cost-aware decision making for story implementation.

## Parameters
- **story**: Story file path or story object to implement
- **complexity_threshold**: Complexity level that triggers advanced analysis (default: medium)
- **cost_budget**: Maximum cost budget for AI assistance (default: $5.00)
- **optimize_for**: Primary optimization goal (speed|cost|quality) (default: quality)
- **enable_pattern_analysis**: Enable code pattern analysis during implementation (default: true)

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Intelligence Analysis

#### Step 1: Story Complexity Analysis
Execute comprehensive complexity analysis of the story:

1. **Load Story Context**:
   - Read story file and extract requirements
   - Analyze acceptance criteria complexity
   - Identify technical dependencies and risks
   - Extract code context if available

2. **Run Complexity Analysis Workflow**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence run_complexity_analysis_workflow \
     task="[story title and requirements]" \
     context="[story context and acceptance criteria]" \
     includeCodeAnalysis=true \
     codeSnippet="[related code if applicable]" \
     generateActionPlan=true
   ```

3. **Complexity Decision Tree**:
   - **Low Complexity**: Standard development with basic AI assistance
   - **Medium Complexity**: Enhanced routing with pattern analysis
   - **High Complexity**: Full intelligence workflow with architecture review

#### Step 2: Optimal Model Routing Setup
Configure intelligent model routing based on complexity:

1. **Determine Task Types**:
   - Code generation tasks → coding-optimized models
   - Analysis tasks → reasoning-optimized models
   - Documentation → summarization-optimized models

2. **Set Cost Constraints**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence route_to_optimal_model \
     prompt="Development task: [story summary]" \
     taskType="coding" \
     complexity="[detected_complexity]" \
     maxCost="[calculated_budget_per_task]"
   ```

3. **Cache Optimization**:
   - Enable semantic caching for similar patterns
   - Set up prompt templates for recurring tasks
   - Configure fallback model chains

### Phase 2: Intelligent Story Implementation

#### Step 3: Context-Aware Development
Implement story with intelligence guidance:

1. **Architecture Pattern Analysis** (if complexity ≥ medium):
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence analyze_code_semantics \
     code="[existing codebase context]" \
     language="typescript" \
     includePatterns=true \
     includeSuggestions=true
   ```

2. **Smart Code Generation**:
   - Use complexity-appropriate models for code generation
   - Apply detected patterns to maintain consistency
   - Implement with architectural guidance

3. **Incremental Validation**:
   - Run pattern analysis after each major code block
   - Validate against complexity recommendations
   - Adjust approach based on real-time feedback

#### Step 4: Quality Assurance Integration
Integrate QA workflows during development:

1. **Real-time Pattern Recognition**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence run_pattern_recognition_workflow \
     codebase="[implemented_code]" \
     language="typescript" \
     analysisDepth="detailed" \
     includeRefactoring=true
   ```

2. **Code Quality Gates**:
   - Automated complexity threshold checks
   - Pattern compliance validation
   - Performance impact assessment

3. **Cost Monitoring**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence get_cost_analytics \
     timeRange="hour" \
     includeOptimizations=true \
     groupBy="task_type"
   ```

### Phase 3: Post-Implementation Optimization

#### Step 5: Comprehensive Analysis
Run complete intelligence analysis on finished work:

1. **Integrated Workflow Analysis**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool ai-clios-intelligence run_integrated_intelligence_workflow \
     task="[story_title]" \
     codebase="[final_implementation]" \
     context="Post-implementation analysis" \
     optimizationGoals=["performance", "cost", "quality"] \
     generateMasterPlan=false
   ```

2. **Final Recommendations**:
   - Extract improvement suggestions
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update development patterns

#### Step 6: Story Completion with Intelligence Metrics
Complete story with enhanced reporting:

1. **Update Story File** with intelligence metrics:
   ```markdown
   ## Intelligence Metrics
   - **Complexity Level**: [detected_level] ([confidence]% confidence)
   - **Total AI Cost**: $[total_cost]
   - **Model Efficiency**: [requests_optimized]/[total_requests] optimized
   - **Pattern Compliance**: [compliance_score]/100
   - **Quality Score**: [quality_metrics]
   ```

2. **Cost Efficiency Report**:
   - Compare actual vs budgeted costs
   - Document cost optimization opportunities
   - Update cost estimation models

## Integration with Dev Agent Commands

### Enhanced `*develop-story` Command
Modify the dev agent's develop-story command to use intelligence workflows:

```yaml
develop-story:
  enhanced-execution:
    - STEP 1: Run story complexity analysis
    - STEP 2: Configure optimal model routing
    - STEP 3: Execute intelligent implementation
    - STEP 4: Real-time quality monitoring  
    - STEP 5: Post-implementation optimization
    - STEP 6: Enhanced story completion with metrics
```

### New Intelligence Commands
Add new commands for manual intelligence control:

```yaml
commands:
  - analyze-complexity: Run complexity analysis on current task
  - optimize-routing: Reconfigure model routing for current context
  - pattern-check: Run pattern analysis on current code
  - cost-status: Show current AI cost usage and optimization
  - intelligence-workflow: Run full integrated intelligence workflow
```

## Success Criteria

### Development Efficiency
- 40% reduction in development time for complex stories
- 90% accuracy in complexity detection
- Optimal model selection in 95% of cases

### Cost Effectiveness

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Intelligence Service Failures
1. **Service Unavailable**: Fall back to standard dev workflow
2. **Cost Budget Exceeded**: Switch to lower-cost models
3. **Analysis Timeout**: Use cached analysis or skip optional steps

### Model Routing Failures
1. **Primary Model Down**: Use fallback model chain
2. **Cost Threshold Hit**: Downgrade to cheaper alternatives
3. **Quality Degradation**: Escalate to premium models

## Usage Examples

### Story with Code Generation
```bash
# Run intelligent workflow for new feature story
*develop-story story="user-authentication-feature.md" \
  complexity_threshold="medium" \
  cost_budget="$3.00" \
  optimize_for="quality" \
  enable_pattern_analysis=true
```

### Legacy Code Refactoring
```bash

  optimize_for="cost" \
  enable_pattern_analysis=true
```

### Quick Bug Fix
```bash  
# Low complexity with speed optimization
*develop-story story="critical-bug-fix.md" \
