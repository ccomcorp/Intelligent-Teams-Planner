# Intelligent Development with AI-Enhanced Workflows

## Task Purpose
Execute development tasks using AI intelligence layer services for complexity analysis, optimal model routing, and cost-efficient implementation patterns. This task integrates intelligence tools into the standard development workflow.

## Parameters
- **story_file**: Path to the story file being implemented
- **implementation_phase**: Phase of development (planning, implementation, testing, review)
- **optimize_for**: Optimization priority (cost, speed, quality, balanced)
- **use_intelligence**: Enable AI intelligence features (default: true)

## Prerequisites
- Intelligence Layer services must be operational
- MCP intelligence tools must be available
- Story requirements must be clearly defined

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Story Complexity Analysis
Analyze the story complexity to determine optimal development approach:

1. **Extract Story Requirements**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool read story file and extract key requirements and acceptance criteria
   ```

2. **Analyze Task Complexity**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool analyze_task_complexity task="${story_description}" context="${story_context}" analysisDepth="detailed" includeRecommendations=true
   ```

3. **Route to Optimal Development Model**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool route_to_optimal_model prompt="Implement this story: ${story_summary}" taskType="coding" complexity="${detected_complexity}" maxCost=0.20
   ```

### Step 2: Intelligence-Enhanced Planning
Use AI insights to create optimal development plan:

1. **Run Complexity Analysis Workflow**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool run_complexity_analysis_workflow task="${story_description}" context="${story_context}" includeCodeAnalysis=true generateActionPlan=true
   ```

2. **Estimate Development Costs**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool get_cost_analytics timeRange="day" includeOptimizations=true
   ```

3. **Generate Development Strategy**:
   Based on complexity analysis, create development approach:
   - **Low Complexity**: Direct implementation with standard tools
   - **Medium Complexity**: Phased implementation with intelligence guidance
   - **High Complexity**: Architecture-first approach with comprehensive intelligence support

### Step 3: Smart Implementation
Execute development with intelligence optimization:

1. **Code Analysis During Development**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool analyze_code_semantics code="${current_implementation}" language="${programming_language}" includePatterns=true includeSuggestions=true
   ```

2. **Pattern Recognition and Optimization**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool run_pattern_recognition_workflow codebase="${implementation_code}" analysisDepth="detailed" includeRefactoring=true
   ```

3. **Cost-Aware Development**:
   - Monitor AI tool usage costs during development
   - Use appropriate model tiers for different tasks
   - Leverage caching for repeated analysis

### Step 4: Intelligence-Enhanced Testing
Apply AI insights to testing strategy:

1. **Analyze Test Complexity**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool analyze_task_complexity task="Create comprehensive tests for ${story_description}" context="Testing and Quality Assurance"
   ```

2. **Cost-Optimized Testing**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool run_cost_optimization_workflow timeRange="hour" optimizationGoals=["reduce_cost", "maintain_quality"]
   ```

3. **Pattern-Based Test Generation**:
   Use detected patterns to inform test strategy and coverage

### Step 5: Quality Assessment with Intelligence
Leverage AI for comprehensive quality evaluation:

1. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool analyze_code_semantics code="${final_implementation}" includePatterns=true includeSuggestions=true
   ```

2. **Performance Pattern Analysis**:
   ```
   *mcp-tool run_pattern_recognition_workflow codebase="${final_implementation}" includeArchitecture=true
   ```

3. **Cost Impact Assessment**:
   Review implementation cost impact and optimization opportunities
