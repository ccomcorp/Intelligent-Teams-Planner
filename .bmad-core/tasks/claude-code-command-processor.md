# Claude Code Command Processor Task

## Task Purpose
Process natural language commands and translate them into BMAD agent actions, bypassing asterisk command limitations in Claude Code.

## Parameters
- **command**: Natural language command string to process
- **context**: Optional context information for command interpretation
- **debug**: Show detailed processing steps (default: false)

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Command Analysis
Parse the natural language command to identify:

1. **Command Intent**:
   - Agent activation ("activate", "start", "run")  
   - Analysis operations ("analyze", "examine", "review")
   - Implementation tasks ("implement", "create", "build", "enhance")
   - Integration workflows ("integrate", "connect", "combine")

2. **Target Components**:
   - Specific components (LearningAnalyticsDashboard, CostAnalytics)
   - System areas (dashboard, interface, architecture)
   - File paths and directories

3. **Intelligence Requirements**:
   - Complexity analysis needs
   - Cost optimization requirements  
   - Performance considerations
   - Real-time data requirements

### Step 2: Command Translation

Based on identified patterns, translate to appropriate BMAD actions:

#### Agent Activation Commands

**Pattern**: "activate {agent} agent [and {action}]"
- Extract agent type (orchestrator, dev, architect, ux, qa)
- Determine if additional action is required
- **Action**: Transform to specified agent, execute additional task if specified

**Example Translations**:
```
"activate orchestrator agent and run brainstorm session"
→ Transform to bmad-orchestrator agent
→ Execute task: facilitate-brainstorming-session.md

"activate dev agent for intelligent development"  
→ Transform to dev agent
→ Enable intelligent-dev-workflow mode
```

#### Analysis Commands

**Pattern**: "analyze {target} [with {intelligence_type}]"
- Identify target component or system
- Determine analysis type (UX, architecture, complexity, cost)
- Map to appropriate intelligence MCP tool

**Example Translations**:
```
"analyze LearningAnalyticsDashboard interface with UX intelligence"
→ Transform to ux-expert agent  
→ Execute: intelligent-ux-workflow with target=LearningAnalyticsDashboard
→ Use MCP tools: analyze_complexity, semantic_search, pattern_recognize

"run complexity analysis on dashboard system"
→ Use MCP tool: analyze_complexity with type=architectural
→ Execute: intelligence-cost-analysis task
```

#### Implementation Commands

**Pattern**: "implement {target} [with {approach}]"
- Extract target system or component
- Identify implementation approach (intelligent, parallel, optimized)
- Configure development workflow parameters

**Example Translations**:
```  
"implement dashboard enhancement with intelligent development"
→ Transform to dev agent
→ Execute: intelligent-dev-workflow 
→ Configure: complexity_threshold=medium, optimize_for=performance
→ Target: packages/web/src/components/dashboard

"enhance dashboard with intelligence metrics and real-time data"
→ Transform to dev agent
→ Execute: intelligent-development task
→ Configure: parallel_tasks=3, real_time_updates=true
```

#### Integration Commands

**Pattern**: "integrate {system1} with {system2} [maintaining {constraint}]"
- Identify systems to integrate
- Extract performance/quality constraints
- Plan integration workflow

**Example Translations**:
```
"integrate cost analytics dashboard with main dashboard system"
→ Transform to architect agent
→ Execute: intelligent-architect-workflow
→ Configure: target=dashboard-integration, optimize_for=maintainability
→ Maintain: performance characteristics, component structure
```

### Step 3: Parameter Extraction and Configuration

Extract and configure parameters for intelligent workflows:

1. **Complexity Thresholds**: 
   - "simple" → complexity_threshold=low
   - "complex" → complexity_threshold=high  
   - "advanced" → complexity_threshold=expert

2. **Cost Budgets**:
   - "cost-effective" → cost_budget=low
   - "standard" → cost_budget=medium
   - "comprehensive" → cost_budget=high

3. **Optimization Goals**:
   - "fast" → optimize_for=speed
   - "efficient" → optimize_for=cost
   - "high-quality" → optimize_for=quality
   - "maintainable" → optimize_for=maintainability

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   - "parallel" → parallel_tasks=3
   - "concurrent" → parallel_tasks=5
   - "sequential" → parallel_tasks=1

### Step 4: Execution Planning

Create execution plan with:

1. **Agent Transformation**: Identify required agent
2. **Task Sequence**: Order of operations for complex commands
3. **Intelligence Integration**: MCP tool calls needed
4. **Validation Points**: Real infrastructure tests required

### Step 5: Command Execution

Execute the translated command:

1. **Agent Activation**: Transform to required agent if needed
2. **Task Execution**: Run identified tasks with extracted parameters
3. **MCP Tool Integration**: Use intelligence tools for analysis/optimization
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress and performance
5. **Validation**: Ensure 100% test pass rate before completion

## Command Pattern Library

### Dashboard Enhancement Patterns

```bash
# UX Analysis
"analyze {component} interface" → ux-expert + analyze_complexity + semantic_search
"review {component} usability" → ux-expert + pattern_recognize + cost_optimize

# Architecture Integration  
"integrate {system} architecture" → architect + intelligent-architect-workflow
"design {component} integration" → architect + analyze_code_semantics + route_optimal_llm

# Development Implementation
"implement {feature} enhancement" → dev + intelligent-dev-workflow
"build {component} with intelligence" → dev + parallel development + MCP tools
```

### Intelligence Workflow Patterns

```bash  
# Complexity Analysis
"run complexity analysis" → analyze_complexity MCP tool
"check task complexity" → ComplexityClassifier service

# Cost Optimization
"optimize costs" → cost_optimize MCP tool + EnhancedCostTracker
"reduce AI expenses" → route_optimal_llm + CacheManager

# Pattern Recognition
"find code patterns" → pattern_recognize MCP tool  
"analyze design patterns" → PatternRecognitionEngine + semantic_search
```

## Integration with BMAD Agents

Update agent command processors to recognize natural language:

### Enhanced Agent Commands

Each BMAD agent should support:
- `nlp-process {command}`: Process natural language command
- `intelligent-mode`: Enable AI-powered workflows  
- `auto-optimize`: Automatic cost/performance optimization

### Agent-Specific Enhancements

**Orchestrator Agent**:
- Coordinate multi-agent natural language workflows
- Manage parallel task execution from single command
- Provide real-time progress updates

**Development Agent**:
- Translate development commands to intelligent workflows
- Auto-configure complexity thresholds and optimization goals
- Integrate real-time code analysis and pattern recognition

**UX Expert Agent**:
- Process interface analysis commands
- Integrate usability metrics and real-time feedback
- Provide actionable UX improvement recommendations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Parse and execute all failing asterisk commands as natural language
- Maintain 100% functionality from original commands
- Provide equivalent or superior intelligence integration

### Performance Requirements  
- Command processing latency < 100ms

## Usage Examples

### Complete Dashboard Enhancement Workflow

```bash
# User Command (replaces complex asterisk sequence):
"run comprehensive dashboard upgrade with intelligence optimization"

# Processed as:
1. Transform to orchestrator agent
2. Execute coordinate-dashboard-upgrade epic  
3. Configure: complexity_threshold=expert, cost_budget=25, parallel_tasks=5
4. Integrate: analyze_complexity, route_optimal_llm, semantic_search, pattern_recognize
5. Optimize: user_experience, performance, cost_efficiency
6. Validate: real infrastructure tests, TypeScript compilation, ESLint
```

This task enables seamless natural language command processing while maintaining full BMAD framework functionality and adding enhanced intelligence capabilities.
