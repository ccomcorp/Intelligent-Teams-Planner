## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Agent Definition
1. **Copy this template** to `.bmad-core/agents/[agent-id].md`
2. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with agent-specific values
3. **Define agent domain expertise** and intelligence tool mapping
4. **Specify parallel development approach** for the agent's work

### Phase 2: Intelligence Workflow Creation
1. **Create intelligent workflow task** at `.bmad-core/tasks/intelligent-[agent-id]-workflow.md`
2. **Map intelligence tools** to agent's domain (analyze_complexity, pattern_recognize, etc.)
3. **Define cost optimization strategy** for the agent's typical operations
4. **Implement model routing logic** based on task complexity and requirements

### Phase 3: Parallel Development Setup
1. **Define subagent roles** for breaking down complex tasks
2. **Implement task isolation** to prevent conflicts
3. **Create coordination mechanisms** for subagent synchronization
4. **Set up resource scheduling** for intelligence tool usage

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance Implementation
1. **Implement *review command** with automated code/work review
2. **Implement *validate command** with real infrastructure testing
3. **Set up TypeScript compilation** validation after each task
4. **Configure ESLint integration** for code quality enforcement

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
1. **Create comprehensive test suite** using real infrastructure only
2. **Implement performance benchmarking** for response time and cost tracking
3. **Validate cross-model compatibility** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
4. **Test parallel development coordination** with multiple concurrent tasks

## Universal Command Patterns

### Intelligent Workflow Execution
```bash
# Standard pattern for all intelligent agents
*i-[agentname] [target] complexity_threshold=medium cost_budget=5 optimize_for=quality

# Examples:
*i-qa packages/intelligence/src/ complexity_threshold=high cost_budget=8 optimize_for=quality
*i-architect system-overview.md complexity_threshold=high cost_budget=10 optimize_for=performance  
*i-sm sprint-backlog.md complexity_threshold=low cost_budget=3 optimize_for=speed
```

### Review and Validation
```bash
# Universal review command (works after any intelligent operation)
*review [scope] [criteria]

# Universal validation command (real infrastructure testing)
*validate [component] --full --performance

# Examples:
*review recent-changes code-quality
*validate intelligence-integration --full
```

### Parallel Development
```bash
# Enable parallel development for complex tasks
*parallel-dev enable max_agents=5 isolation=strict

# Coordinate subagents for large implementations
*i-dev story-complex-feature.md parallel_tasks=4 coordination=automatic
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Execution Validation
1. **Intelligence Service Health Check**: Verify all required intelligence tools are available
2. **Cost Budget Validation**: Ensure sufficient budget for planned operations  
3. **Resource Availability**: Check for concurrent usage conflicts
4. **Target Validation**: Verify target files/scope exist and are accessible

### Post-Execution Validation
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: `npm run build` must pass
2. **ESLint Validation**: `npm run lint` must pass with zero errors
3. **Real Infrastructure Testing**: `npm run test` with actual database/service connections
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Response time and cost efficiency within targets
5. **Quality Metrics**: Agent-specific quality criteria met

### Continuous Monitoring
1. **Cost Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of intelligence layer usage
2. **Performance Metrics**: Response time and resource utilization
3. **Quality Scores**: Automated assessment of output quality
4. **Error Tracking**: Detection and handling of intelligence service failures

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Intelligence Service Failures
- **Service Unavailable**: Fall back to standard agent operation without intelligence
- **Cost Budget Exceeded**: Switch to lower-cost models or reduce analysis depth
- **Analysis Timeout**: Use cached results or simplified analysis approaches

### Parallel Development Issues
- **Subagent Conflicts**: Automatic conflict resolution with user notification
- **Resource Contention**: Queue management for intelligence tool access
- **Coordination Failures**: Fallback to sequential task execution

### Quality Assurance Failures  
- **Compilation Errors**: Automatic fix suggestions with intelligence assistance
- **Test Failures**: Detailed analysis and remediation recommendations
- **Performance Issues**: Optimization suggestions and alternative approaches
