# Claude Code Command Processor

## Overview

This processor translates natural language commands into BMAD agent actions, bypassing the asterisk command issue in Claude Code.

## Command Mapping

### Agent Activation Commands
- "activate {agent} agent" → Agent transformation
- "run {task} with {agent}" → Task execution with specific agent
- "start {workflow}" → Workflow initiation

### Intelligence Commands
- "analyze {target} with intelligence" → MCP intelligence tool calls
- "optimize {aspect} using intelligence" → Cost/performance optimization
- "run complexity analysis on {target}" → Complexity analysis workflow
- "route request to optimal model" → LLM routing optimization

### Dashboard Commands  
- "analyze interface {component}" → UX intelligence analysis
- "integrate dashboard {system}" → Dashboard integration workflow
- "enhance dashboard with {metrics}" → Dashboard enhancement

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Command Pattern Recognition
1. Parse natural language input for command intent
2. Extract target components and parameters
3. Map to appropriate BMAD agent and task combination

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration
1. Activate required agent based on command type
2. Execute intelligent workflows with proper parameters
3. Coordinate multi-agent tasks for complex operations

### Phase 3: Intelligence Integration
1. Use MCP intelligence tools for analysis and optimization
2. Provide real-time feedback on operations
3. Integrate cost tracking and performance metrics

## Command Examples

### Original Failing Commands → Claude Code Compatible

```bash
# Failed: *i-orchestrator activate *brainstorm session
# Works: "activate orchestrator agent and run brainstorm session"

# Failed: *i-ux analyze-interface component=LearningAnalyticsDashboard
# Works: "analyze LearningAnalyticsDashboard interface with UX intelligence"

# Failed: *i-architect analyze-system target=dashboard-integration  
# Works: "run architecture analysis for dashboard integration"

# Failed: *i-dev implement-dashboard-enhancement target=packages/web/src/components/dashboard
# Works: "implement dashboard enhancement with intelligent development"
```
